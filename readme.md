I performed VaR forecasting and compared results with those from "SELECTION OF VALUE AT RISK MODELS FOR ENERGY COMMODITIES" BY ALESSANDRO G. LAPORTA, LUCA MERLO, LEA PETRELLA and "CAVIAR: CONDITIONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE VALUE AT RISK BY REGRESSION QUANTILES" BY R. F. ENGLE AND S. MANGANELLI.

This project was meant to perform financial data analysis and estimating VaR via Quantile Regression in files 1 and 2. Authors code was used for educational purposes and MERITS OF THIS WORK ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED CHIEFLY TO THEM.
I also adapted these models in file 5 to replicate paper Forecasting value-at-risk by encompassing CAViaR models via information criteria  by  Sangyeol Lee, Jungsik Noh.
